## PBM 1: Print stair case #

  function printHash(n) {
    for(let i=1;i<=n;i++){
       console.log(''.padEnd(i,'#').padStart(n,'.'))
    }
  }
  printHash(4)
  
  OUTPUT: 
               #
              ##
             ###
            ####

## PBM 2: Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

 let sumArr = [0,0]
    const sorted = arr.sort();
    const len = sorted.length-1;
    for(const [key,value] of sorted.entries()){
        if(key !== 0){
             sumArr[1] += value;
        }
        if(key !== len){
             sumArr[0] += value;
        }
    }
    console.log(sumArr.join(' '))
}

## PBM 3: You are in charge of the cake for a child's birthday. You have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of their total age. They will only be able to blow out the tallest of the candles. Count how many candles are tallest.
  function birthdayCakeCandles(candles) {
    // Write your code here
    const sorted = arr.sort();
    const max = sorted[sorted.length - 1]
    let candlesCount = 0;
    candlesCount = sorted.filter(ar=>ar==max).length
    console.log(candlesCount)
}
